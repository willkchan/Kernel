# Instructions for building a minimalistsic kernel, for practice sake and not suitable for full OS environment but good start for learning OS dev.


1) Install dependencies with dependencies script
./dependencies.sh

2) Make a src directory in $home
sudo mkdir $HOME/src

3) cd in src directory install source folders for gcc and binutils
cd $HOME/src

4) Run preparation.sh script in src folder
source ./preparation.sh
or
. ./preparation.sh

4.1) unzip packages if zipped 

5) # making sure script runs for correct version of source folder
run compile binutils script in src folder
./comple_binutils.sh

6) Run preparation2.sh to export path to cross compiler
source ./preparation2.sh

7) # making sure script runs for correct version of source folder
# When building complier it is recommended that we build a compiler not newer than the one in your system as you may run into problem elsewise
# Workaround is building a new compiler for system if the installed compiler is newer than the current host system
# However, 7.5.0 --> 7.5.3 is not big problem compared it 7.5.0 --> 11.0.1
run build libgcc script in scr folder

./build_libgcc.sh
./build_libgcc2.sh

8) check and update path
$HOME/opt/cross/bin/$TARGET-gcc --version
source ./preparation3.sh

# Now that we have a cross compiler we can use it to build our kernel
9) compile objects from start.s and kernel.c to yield start.o and kernel.o
i686-elf-gcc -std=gnu99 -ffreestanding -g -c start.s -o start.o
i686-elf-gcc -std=gnu99 -ffreestanding -g -c kernel.c -o kernel.o

10) We link the two objects together to make our final executable kernel
i686-elf-gcc -T linker.ld -o myos.bin -ffreestanding -O2 -nostdlib start.o kernel.o -lgcc
or
./link_kernel.sh

11) Run sanity check to make sure our your file has a valid multibook header

./sanity_checkm2.sh

11.1) Make a grub.cfg with contents
menuentry "myos" {
	multiboot /boot/myos.bin
}

12) Build the a bootable cdrom image with script
./build_iso.sh

13) Test your operating system
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom myos.iso
# check if it loads the message correctly
